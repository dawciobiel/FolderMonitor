// fixme: When a new file appears, FileMonitor will react repeatedly:
//- a new file has been detected
//- the file has been modified
//- the file has been modified

//I am not sure if this behavior is correct or what it causes.

//If an existing file has been modified, FileMonitor will react twice:
//- the file has been modified
//- the file has been modified
